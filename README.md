# translate-ro-to-en
Utilizing opeai-whisper to transcribe Romanian to text and then translating to English with gemma-3-12b

Currently the transcription and translation outputs only to the terminal. 

My goal would be to get a gui setup, so a user can select the live romanian feed and then have openai-whisper speak the translated text to a selected output source.
